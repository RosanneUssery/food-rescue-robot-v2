## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. We are excited to have you here!

Food Rescue Robot v2 is a Ruby/Vue project created in service to the Denver Food Rescue organization to allow them to better coordinate their volunteers and food donations. As such, it uses the Ruby back end and Vue front end to give volunteers an interface with which they can sign up for shifts, log their time and travel, log the donations, and much more. The team on this project is comprised of both experienced and new developers, so everyone is welcome, no matter their skill level. If you are a new developer, please be sure to carefully follow this guide. If you are experienced, please provide PR reviewa to help the newer developers grow their skills. No matter your skill level, welcome and thank you for contributing your time!

## How We Work
Since this is a Ruby project in part, we ascribe to the MINASWAN philosophy: *Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice*. When providing or receiving feedback on your contribution, remember that everyone is here to do their best, to learn, and to contribute to a worthy cause. As such, kindness, benefit of the doubt, and assumption of positive intent will help create our culture of collaboration and cooperation to get this project over the line.

If you are not the author of a PR branch, please leave constructive and helpful feedback on the PRs of others. This not only helps them learn, but it also helps you learn more about the codebase and the project. We ask for at least one approval on every PR branch before it can be merged into Main.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. For more information, please see our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?
Since this is a Ruby project, if you intend to work on the back end, you will want to have Ruby 3.0.2 installed on your machine. We are using Vue v.2.5.2 on the front end as well. Familiarity with how to use and install these frameworks will help you get started. Basic Git commands and utilization will also help you as well as an understanding of Ruby's `gem` commands and Vue's `npm` or `yarn` package builders.

Having an IDE (integrated development environment) will also help. Some free ones that work well are [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom#installing) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
