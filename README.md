Welcome to food_rescue_robot_v2!

This is a new repo intended for infrastructure for the new and improved Food Rescue Robot (v2). Denver Food Rescue currently uses the [food-rescue-robot](https://github.com/boulder-food-rescue/food-rescue-robot), but unfortunately it has not been maintained much of its functionality is deprecated or outdated. 

FRRv2 is intended to be its replacement with fresh user stories from the volunteers who use the current application. Our goal is to build and maintain it to be a resource they can use for many years to come. We will be using Ruby on Rails and Vue JS to create this new project. 

Proposed Project Timeline:
* September 2021 - User stories gathered, repos initialized and infrastructure is set up
* October 2021-January 2022 - Ruby on Rails back end and Vue Js front end are created with functionality mirroring user stories for MVP
* February 2022 - Integration and User testing for MVP are completed
* March 2022-June 2022 - MVP is iterated on, improvements are made
